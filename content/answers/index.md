| Problem      | Solution |
| ------------ | -------- |
|  **Household food loss**|
| A huge amount of surplus food is thrown away because people often cook more than they can eat. <br>(Food waste in households is the largest  portion of all food waste; one-third of it is caused by over-preparing and over-serving [foodprint](https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste))|We encourage people to share the food surplus with other people.|
|**Social**| 
|Although people usually don’t like to eat alone (and researches show that this is not recommended: [Time](https://time.com/4995466/eating-alone-metabolic-syndrome/), [theguardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/06/is-it-true-that-eating-alone-is-bad-for-you), there is no socially acceptable way to share a meal with a stranger.<br>Even when people have a food surplus, they feel confused to invite neighbors or strangers for a lunch.| The application provides a convenient and safe way to eat with a stranger.|
| **Tourist traps**|
| A tourist arriving in a new country often cannot taste authentic home food and meet real locals, and pay an extra price in tourist places| Similarly to Couchsurfing, we build a community where people from all over the world can visit each other — true people, real local free home food.|
|**Financial**|
|Cooking daily just for one person is expensive and time-consuming.| By cooking for several dishes today and being invited by your neighbor tomorrow, you don’t only eat fresh food daily, but also eat more diverse cuisine and spend less time and money on food!
|**Estrangement**
|In an urban environment, people often experience loneliness and isolation but still feel uncomfortable communicating with next-door neighbors.|We create a sustainable community of dining mates. We thrive to build a community in a way where food sharing is a trendy activity — a similar way as sharing your apartment using CouchSurfing —  but easier and more joyful.|
